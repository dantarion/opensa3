= Introduction =
Tabuu's scripting system allows for one to automate tasks that normally would require a lot of work. It uses IronPython, a .NET compatible Python interpreter, to expose the information inside the currently opened files to a skilled user of the program.

= Global Variables =
When the script panel is opened, by default, Tabuu will define some variables to allow you to access the files that have been opened. Heres a overview of them.

|| *Variable Name* || Description || Type ||
||loadedFiles||List of the loaded files. Iterate through this to batch operations on all loaded files || List of DatElement||

= Examples =
== Iterate through all loaded files ==
{{{
for file in loadedFiles:
	print file
}}}
This example can be extended to do any operation on all files loaded in Tabuu.
== Print usage report ==
{{{
print loadedFiles[0].Report(0)
}}}
